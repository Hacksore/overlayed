Overlayed releases are not quite that frequent as it's just a small passion project for me. So if there is a need to get a new feature that's not yet released then you can install the Overlayed canary version.

### Navigate to Github

<div class="bg-blue-900 border border-blue-500 text-white p-3 w-fit">
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <p style="margin: 0px;">NOTE: you need to have a github.com account and be logged in</p>
</div>

Head over to the [github.com actions page](https://github.com/Hacksore/overlayed/actions/workflows/canary.yaml). Now find the latest canary build that has a green checkmark and click on it.

Then you can download the install for you platform.

Once it's installed you will have "Overlayed-Canary" that will have the latest features.
