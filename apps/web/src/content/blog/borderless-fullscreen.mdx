This guide will show you how to enable games to be played in [Borderless Windowed Mode](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Glossary:Windowed#Borderless_fullscreen_windowed). This will allow you to have Overlayed visible in almost any game that supports Borderless Windowed Mode.

### Check In-Game Settings
Many modern games include a borderless windowed mode option in their settings. Here’s how to check:

- **Launch the Game**: Start the game and navigate to the main menu.
- **Open Settings**: Look for the “Settings,” “Options,” or “Preferences” menu.
- **Graphics/Display Settings**: Go to the graphics or display settings tab.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Look for options labeled “Fullscreen,” “Windowed,” or “Borderless Windowed.”
- **Select Borderless Windowed**: Choose “Borderless Windowed” or similar option.
- **Apply Changes**: Save or apply the changes and restart the game if necessary.
