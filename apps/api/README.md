# api

a CF worker that's is a REST API for handling updates

`api.overlayed.dev`

> By default wrangler dev runs in local development mode. In this mode, all operations performed by your local worker will operate against local storage on your machine. Use wrangler dev --remote if you want R2 operations made during development to be performed against a real R2 bucket.

So if i want to test against the prod r2 bucket i need to run with `--remote`
